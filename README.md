# 🤠 RoundUp — A Western-Themed Queueing System for Help Hours

Welcome to **RoundUp**, the award-winning help hour management system created during the **WICS Hackathon**, where we proudly received the **Best Design** award! 🏆

## 🚀 Overview

RoundUp is a Western-themed online queueing system designed for **Intro to Programming** and **Data Structures** students at **UT Austin** attending **TA help hours**. Instead of waiting in line for hours, students can now:

- 📝 **Join the queue virtually** by submitting their name and phone number.
- 📱 **Receive an SMS notification** 5 minutes before it’s their turn.
- 💬 **Participate in a collaborative chat area** where students and TAs can ask and answer lab-related questions.

## 🎯 Problem We Solved

Students attending help hours often experience:

- Long and unpredictable wait times ⏳
- Unclear queue positions 🤷‍♀️
- Missed opportunities to be productive while waiting

**RoundUp** solves these issues by making the wait smarter and more efficient — students can leave and return right when they’re needed.
